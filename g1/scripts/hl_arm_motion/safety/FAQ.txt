Safety FAQ
==========

Q: What does `keyboard_controller.py` do?
A: It runs the hanger boot sequence, then opens a small curses HUD for driving the Unitree G-1 with WASD-style keys. It sends velocity commands at 10 Hz while keys are held.

Q: How do I run it?
A: `python3 keyboard_controller.py --iface enp68s0f1` where `--iface` is the robot network interface.

Q: What are the controls?
A: `W/S` forward/back, `A/D` yaw left/right, `Q/E` strafe left/right, `Space` zero all velocities, `Z` damp and exit, `Esc` StopMove + ZeroTorque (emergency stop) and exit.

Q: Why does motion stop as soon as I release a key?
A: This is intentional. The script continuously sends commands only while the key is physically held, and resets the velocity to zero on key release.

Q: Can I hold multiple keys at once?
A: Yes. The controller supports simultaneous key holds (e.g., `W + A` to move forward while turning).

Q: What dependencies does the keyboard controller need?
A: It uses `pynput` for key state, `curses` for the HUD, and the Unitree SDK client used by `hanger_boot_sequence.py`. Install `pynput` with `pip install pynput`.

Q: Why does `pynput` sometimes fail on Wayland?
A: On Wayland, `pynput` may fall back to `/dev/input/event*`, which can require extra permissions or udev group tweaks. On X11, it generally works without sudo.

Q: What does `hanger_boot_sequence.py` do?
A: It brings a hanging G-1 from Damp to a balanced stand ready for walking (FSM-200), and returns an initialized `LocoClient`.

Q: What if the robot is already standing and balanced?
A: The boot sequence checks for FSM-200 with feet loaded and returns immediately without re-running the sequence to avoid jolting the robot.

Q: What if the feet never “load” during the stand-height sweep?
A: The script warns, reduces stand height, prompts you to adjust the hanger height, and repeats the sweep until feet loaded (mode 0) is detected.
