FAQ: G1 Stability Visualization Approach

Q: What does the script connect to?
A: It uses Unitree SDK2 DDS topics via ChannelFactoryInitialize and subscribes to `rt/lowstate` for IMU and `rt/odom` for pose when available.

Q: Why use `rt/lowstate` for stability?
A: `rt/lowstate` contains IMU rpy (roll, pitch, yaw). Stability is derived from roll/pitch tilt, which is a direct indicator of balance.

Q: How is the stability score computed?
A: Stability = 1.0 - (tilt_deg / max_tilt_deg), clamped at 0.0. Tilt is sqrt(roll^2 + pitch^2) converted to degrees.

Q: What do the plots show?
A: The top plot shows roll, pitch, yaw, and tilt in degrees over a moving time window. The bottom plot shows the stability score in real time.

Q: Why include odometry if stability is IMU-based?
A: Odometry is optional context. The script reports the latest (x, y) pose in the status line to correlate tilt events with motion.

Q: What network interface and domain id should I use?
A: For real robot: `--iface eth0 --domain-id 0`. For simulation: `--iface lo --domain-id 1`, unless your setup differs.

Q: Why use Matplotlib instead of OpenCV?
A: Matplotlib is already installed in the repo and provides clean time-series plots for roll/pitch/yaw and stability.

Q: How do I adjust sensitivity?
A: Change `--max-tilt-deg`. Lower values make the stability score drop faster for small tilts.

Q: What if I do not see data?
A: Confirm the DDS domain id, network interface, and that `rt/lowstate` is being published. The script will display “Waiting for rt/lowstate...” until data arrives.
