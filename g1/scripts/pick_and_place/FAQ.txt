FAQ - G1 Hardcoded Pick/Place Approach

Q: What is this approach?
A: It is a hardcoded, open-loop motion pattern using Unitree's Python SDK.
   The script sends joint-space targets on `rt/arm_sdk` for the right arm and
   simple Dex3 hand commands on `rt/dex3/right/cmd` to open/close the hand.

Q: Why hardcoded poses instead of IK or perception?
A: The goal is a simple, repeatable demo path. It avoids dependencies on
   calibration, vision, or model-based control. You can later swap the
   poses for IK solutions or perception-driven targets.

Q: How does it control the arm?
A: It publishes `LowCmd_` messages on `rt/arm_sdk` at a fixed rate (50 Hz
   by default), with joint-space PD targets for shoulder/elbow/wrist and
   optional waist yaw.

Q: How does it control the Dex3 hand?
A: It publishes `HandCmd_` on `rt/dex3/right/cmd` with per-joint targets.
   Grasp is approximated by low `kp` and a small `tau` to limit force.

Q: How are force limits handled for grabbing a soda can?
A: The script uses a low proportional gain (`kp`) and a small constant
   torque (`tau`) during close. This is a crude force limit that reduces
   crush risk on a compliant object like a can.

Q: Why is it open-loop and not checking contact or slip?
A: This is an initial high-level pattern only. It does not subscribe to
   `HandState_` or force estimates. Add feedback if you need robust grasp.

Q: What if the hand joints move in the wrong order?
A: Some firmware examples swap index/middle joint orderings. If the hand
   closes incorrectly, swap the index/middle elements in `HAND_OPEN` and
   `HAND_CLOSED` inside the script.

Q: What does "place a few cm away" mean in the script?
A: The pattern rotates shoulder yaw to move the can laterally a small
   distance while maintaining roughly the same reach. Adjust that pose
   if you want a larger offset.

Q: Is it safe to run while walking?
A: The script assumes a stable stand. If you want to walk, use the loco
   client to stop and balance before manipulation.

Q: How do I change the target pose?
A: Edit the `POSES` dict in the script. The `reach_front` and `place_*`
   entries define the forward reach and placement positions.

Q: Which interface and DDS domain are used?
A: Defaults are `--iface eth0` and domain `0`, consistent with typical
   robot deployments. Change via CLI if your setup differs.

Q: Where is the script?
A: `scripts/pick_and_place/g1_pick_place_hardcoded.py`
