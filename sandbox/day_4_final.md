- Basics: input preprocessing, model inference, and binary classification.
- Target: detect if an object is a soda can.

---

## Decision making

- Basics: simple state machine to connect perception to actions.
- Trigger pick-and-place when detection confidence exceeds a threshold.

---

## Reinforcement Learning

- Short theory: policy, reward, and sim-to-real transfer.
- IsaacLab/Isaac Gym intro and example workflow for G1.

- Necessary modules: locomotion, perception, arm control, and basic decision logic.
- Suggested task: obstacle parcours with object detection and a pick action.
